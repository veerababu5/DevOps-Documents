To store Docker credentials securely in Ansible, you can use Ansible Vault. Ansible Vault allows you to encrypt sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, and other credentials. Here's how you can use Ansible Vault to store Docker credentials and then use them in your playbook:

### 1. Encrypt Docker Credentials:
Create a new file to store Docker credentials, for example, `docker_credentials.yml`, and encrypt it using Ansible Vault:

```bash
ansible-vault create docker_credentials.yml
```

Enter and confirm a password when prompted. Then, add your Docker credentials in the file:

```yaml
docker_username: your_docker_username
docker_password: your_docker_password
```

Save and close the file. Ansible Vault will encrypt its contents.

### 2. Use Encrypted Docker Credentials in Playbook:
You can now use these encrypted Docker credentials in your playbook. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```yaml
---
- name: Push Docker Image
  hosts: localhost
  vars_files:
    - docker_credentials.yml


```

### 3. Run the Playbook:
When running the playbook, Ansible will prompt you to enter the Vault password to decrypt the `docker_credentials.yml` file.

```bash
ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

Enter the password you set when encrypting the file.

### Note:
- Make sure to keep your Vault password secure, as it is used to decrypt sensitive data.
- You can also use other methods to provide Docker credentials securely, such as environment variables, Docker configuration files, or Docker credential helpers, depending on your requirements and environment.
